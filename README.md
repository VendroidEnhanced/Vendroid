## About  

VendroidPlus aims to improve upon the original **Vendroid** app, which was initially developed by Vendicated, Wing, and Xinto. As the original Vendroid project is no longer actively maintained, this fork continues its legacy with improvements and new features.  

As the Discord mobile website has some inherent bugs, this app might not always be 100% stable. The goal of VendroidPlus is to fix broken features, enable missing functionalities, and provide a better overall experience.  

If you‚Äôre looking for alternative mobile mods, consider these:  
- **[Aliucord](https://github.com/Aliucord)**: Based on the pre-React Native version of Discord.  
- **[Bunny](https://github.com/Bunny-Mod)**: A Vendetta fork.
